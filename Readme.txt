In this Syndicator software project, I made a platform to let school clubs be able to register their club events during campus daytime, which is from 10:00 to 22:00. Additionally, students can view what events these clubs will hold recetly.

In the homepage, u can see what club events will be held these day by choosing alocation with a given date, or that a keyword search about the club events is also okay. You can also register the events on the booking page by giving the website your club name, time, and purpose etc. After registration, you will see your event by searching on the homepage.


Booking Restriction : 
No club can book over 1 event in any location within a single day, the page will block you registration if you violate it.

In one hour unit, every place can only be booked by three clubs because of the limited rooms provided to students. Ex 15:00 to 20:00 has been booked by basketball team, 16:00 to 21:00 has been booked by Chorus, and 11:00 to 18:00 has been booked by surfing club, then you cannot book an event during 16:00 to 18:00 cuz there's no rooms available at this time.

Time format need to be correct, like your booking time should be within 10:00 to 22:00, the start time should be earleir than end time, and you cannot book a rooms at any date that is earlier than today. If you violate it, the website will refuse your booking.
